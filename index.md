My name is Ronald van Zuijlen and I'm from Utrecht, the Netherlands. I'm often referred to as a nerd, like to run (sometimes), love my gf and enjoy coding on my Macbook.
 
I'm currently employed at [NederCare B.V](http://www.nedercare.nl) where I'm building a solid java-based webapplication for careworkers.
