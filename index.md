My name is Ronald van Zuijlen and I'm from Utrecht, the Netherlands. I'm often referred to as a nerd, like to run (sometimes), love my gf and enjoy coding on my Macbook.
 
I'm currently employed at [Siteworkers](http://www.siteworkers.nl) and am getting my head around the [Play framework](http://playframework.org) while implementing kick@ss sites for our customers.
