Changed my mind about moving from blog to completely static site. I at least want to have the option to blog once more, but it should be the main focus on the site. Decided to take the opportunity to learn how Jekyll works, so revising my site here to use Jekyll static site genrator.

Repo contains my static webpage that hosts ronaldvanzuijlen.nl, as I'm not blogging anymore.
