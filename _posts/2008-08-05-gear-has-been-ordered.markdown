I've made my choice. I've been playing a bit with Steph's Mac and it occured to me that I'm a larger controlfreak then I thought I was. And above all: I'm now saving loads of money and will have a speedy pc which (hopefully) will stay with me for quite some years.

<strong>The specs: </strong>
<ul>
	<li><a title="Motherboard" href="http://asus.com/products.aspx?l1=3&amp;l2=11&amp;l3=584&amp;l4=0&amp;model=1929&amp;modelmenu=2" target="_blank">P5E-V HDMI</a> (motherboard)</li>
	<li>Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 (processor)</li>
	<li>8GB DDR2-800 (internal memory)</li>
	<li>250GB SATA2 7200 (harddisk)</li>
</ul>
The motherboard has an integrated video-card, which is fine by me as the specs of the onboard card are better then my current videocard (omg...).Hope it will be delivered before I'm on holiday :). What I like about the <a title="ZaReason.de" href="http://www.zareason.de" target="_blank">shop</a> I bought it from: they deliver their systems with Linux only...
