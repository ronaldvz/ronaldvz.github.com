Sometimes I really dissappoint myself. I've written several <a title="Falling back into old habits" href="/2007/12/01/een-gewoontedier-thats-me.html"> blogposts</a> (watch out, it's dutch) earlier about me falling back into old habits. That was 10 months ago, now I find myself in the same situation.

I am:

1. not achieving to regularly write a blogpost
2. about to get back into my old habit of playing tennis (this one's not that bad)
3. developing a new habit of visiting my soon to be new <a title="Pics of my new apartment" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/ronaldvanzuijlen/Hagesteinstraat#" target="_blank">home</a> every week
4. ordering a pizza each freaking monday
5. getting back into my old habit of repeating the fact I'm falling back into old habits....
