This weekend I've managed to do something quite useful. After lots of preparations, it's finally done: the new website of <a title="Stichting Patakalas" href="http://www.patakalas.nl" target="_blank">Stichting Patakalas</a> is online:

Patakalas is a well-fair organisation aiming on helping orphans in Arequipa, Peru. As one of their boardmembers is a good friend of mine, I decided to help them out with a proper website. I've moved their website from Drupal to Wordpress, hope they will enjoy it!
