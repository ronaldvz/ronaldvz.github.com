Only two more months and we will get the key to our new home. When I moved to <a title="New apartment:Â pics!" href="http://ronaldvz.wordpress.com/2009/10/31/new-apartment-pics/">my apartment</a> in October 2009, I never would've thought I'd move again so soon. Nevertheless, I'm happy to go!

Today, we were invited to visit our new home. Feels pretty weird to walk into a house with a big living room, two upper floors containing 3 bedrooms and a 40m2 garden at the back of this house, knowing you will be living here in two months. Can't wait!
