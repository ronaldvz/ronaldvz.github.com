I thinking about buying me a new messenger bag (and no, I'm not a bike messenger). I'm kinda getting annoyed by the lack of compartmens in my current backpack, and want to have a messenger bag for a change. It should be sturdy enough the securely move my Macbook, while at the same time shouldn't be too heavy. Below, I'll describe my suspects:

## Bonobo Messenger Bag

<a href="http://ronaldvz.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/us_messenger_top01.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-344  " title="Bluelounge Bonobo Messenger Bag" src="http://ronaldvz.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/us_messenger_top01.jpg?w=300" alt="Bluelounge Bonobo Messenger Bag" width="240" height="230" /></a>

This nice looking messenger bag from <a title="Bluelounge" href="http://www.bluelounge.com" target="_blank">Bluelounge </a>fits in very nicely into the product-portfolio of this company. The bag has an urban look, which is mostly why I like it. I'm not sure yet if the bag has the amount of compartments I'm looking for. Furthermore, I think this bag might be a bit too big for my needs. The website tells me a 17" Macbook would fit in there, which makes me think the bag is far too big for my small 13" laptop. Still searching for a nice video review of this bag on Youtube to make sure.

## Timbuk 2 Custom Messenger Bag

Timbuk 2 sells custom messenger bags, meaning you can <a title="Timbuk 2 Custom Messenger bag" href="http://www.timbuk2.com/tb2/custom#/sizeId=4&amp;customProductSetId=9&amp;uid=59234" target="_blank">customize</a> the bag to your own likings. I really like this idea and am very tempted to go for this one. Only problem: it's an expensive bag (starts at $ 140,00) and I would need to pay for international shipping ($ 30 - 50) because the bags are sent from SanÂ Francisco. So that seems to be a no-go.

## Crumpler Ziptease

<a href="http://ronaldvz.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/009_bbb-003-thumbnail-350-3501.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-356  " title="Crumpler Ziptease" src="http://ronaldvz.files.wordpress.com/2012/01/009_bbb-003-thumbnail-350-3501.jpg?w=300" alt="Crumpler Ziptease" width="144" height="144" /></a>

Crumpler also has some nice messenger bags in stock. They made a nice movie about their Ziptease laptop bag I like: <a title="watch it here" href="http://www.crumpler.eu/video/play.swf?file=/uploadPim/7398/15/SJ_BBB_CHS_001-004_06-2011__Animation_Files.flv" target="_blank">watch it here</a>. This bag has plenty compartments and I like the way the bag is opened. I like that fact is closes with both velcro as well as buckles.

The advantage of the Crumpler bag is that they seem to have European offices, so I might be able to get it from a store close to me. It would cost me &euro; 139,-.

Ah well, I haven't decided just yet. Which bag do you like? Any other suggestions?
