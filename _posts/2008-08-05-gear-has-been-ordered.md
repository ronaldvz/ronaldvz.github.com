I've made my choice. I've been playing a bit with Steph's Mac and it occured to me that I'm a larger controlfreak then I thought I was. And above all: I'm now saving loads of money and will have a speedy pc which (hopefully) will stay with me for quite some years.

## The specs:

* [P5E-V HDMI](http://asus.com/products.aspx?l1=3&amp;l2=11&amp;l3=584&amp;l4=0&amp;model=1929&amp;modelmenu=2)
* Intel Core 2 Duo E8400 (processor)
* 8GB DDR2-800 (internal memory)
* 250GB SATA2 7200 (harddisk)

The motherboard has an integrated video-card, which is fine by me as the specs of the onboard card are better then my current videocard (omg...).Hope it will be delivered before I'm on holiday :). What I like about the [shop](http://www.zareason.de "ZaReason.de"). I bought it from: they deliver their systems with Linux only...
