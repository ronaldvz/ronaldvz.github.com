Sometimes I'm really stunned by the fact that life is as fast as it is. Two weeks ago I was studying Wicket and Hibernate at <a title="Sogyo Website" href="http://www.sogyo.nl" target="_blank">Sogyo</a> in de Bilt. As of today, I'm working at <a title="Forest &amp; Fields" href="http://www.forest-fields.nl" target="_blank">Forest &amp; Fields</a> in Alphen aan de Rijn, teaching myself how to work with the <a title="Escenic Website" href="http://www.escenic.com" target="_blank">Escenic CMS</a>. And that's not all that's new this year ^_^.<!--more--><a title="Escenic Website" href="http://www.escenic.com" target="_blank"> </a>

As I pointed out in <a href="http://www.ronaldvanzuijlen.nl/?p=13">this post</a> (dutch), one of my main goals in 2008 was finding a new place to live. Yesterday, rumor has it, I got contacted by my real estate agent. She congratulated me with my <a title="My new home" href="http://www.hagesteinstraat.nl/site/gfx/algemeen/ai_type_c_large.jpg" target="_blank">new apartment</a>! (the one on the left, with it's window behind the car on the picture :)). I'm thrilled! Shocked really... I graduated like 6 months ago and now I'm about to buy a brand new apartment, I mean..what the hell?
