As of today, I'm back on opensource. After quite some time using Mac OSx (and still using it at work), I kinda missed tweaking around my personal linux machine. I sold my MBP some time ago, and decided to buy a laptop specifically meant to run Linux. My search for the perfect machine was fed by a podcast that I listen to frequently: the [Linux Action Show](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/show/linuxactionshow) (LAS) from Jupiter Broadcasting. LAS supports (and is sponsored by) [System76](http://www.system76.com), which got me to do some investigating on the models that System76 had to offer. 

That brought me to the following System76 14inch Lemur laptop:

* 14.1" Matte 1080p IPS LED Backlit Display
* 3,1GHz i7-6500U CPU 
* 16gb Dual-channel DDR3 at 1600 Mhz
* Intel HD Graphics 520 
* 120GB m.2 SSD (540MB/s read, 500MB/s write)

This all set me back $1069,-, excluding shipping costs ($120,-(!)) and taxes (20%), which ended up to be more cash than I expected. Nonetheless; I believe it has been worth it. 

The System76 machines come with Ubuntu by default, - I chose the latest LTS: 16.04 -, and everything seems to work out of the box. I installed the i3 window manager and am in the process of tweaking it to my needs.

## Upsides
The Lemur has two USB3 ports and one USB2 port, a HDMI out, a VGA out, two separate jacks for the headphones and microphone and a ethernet connector. Enough room to plug-in whatever I like! It also has a card-reader to plug-in my camera's SD card.

Another upside is the size of the powerbrick that came with it, which is very small! It is an ideal size for a small laptop and might even be small enough to fit in the sleeve I'll be buying for the Lemur. Small downside to that is that it came with a US powercord, which is not usable in the Netherlands. Easily fixed by buying a converter, but I'll need to bring that with me everywhere.

What I really like about the laptop is its keyboard; it has a nice feel to it and is accurate. Only thing I find myself hitting all the time is the F1 key when trying to reach for the Escape key, but that might be me getting used to a non-mac keyboard.

The overall performance of the laptop is more than satisfactory. The Skylake processor with 16GB of ram and a nice SSD is a great combination that proves to work perfectly for me. I hope the combination will keep up with me for at least 4 years; that's the amount of time I hope it will last.

As my previous laptop was a 2011 MacbookPro (non-retina), it's inevitable that I have high expectations of my new laptop's battery life. That said, I'm quite pleased with the battery life of the Lemur. It can hold up to about 5.5 to 6 hours when performing normal tasks like writing a document or browsing the web (no real demanding tasks). When gaming, the Lemur holds up to about 4 tot 4.5 hours on its battery. That's while playing Pillars of Eternity on Steam.

## Downsides 
I would define the build quality of the laptop to be nice, but not as sturdy as I would like it to be. It's not a aluminium body like my macbook, and that makes a difference. I can live with it, but would note it as a downside. The only real hardware related downside I can mention is the quality of sound over the laptop's speakers. Plain and simple: it sucks. It sounds like I'm in a tin can when I play whatever kind of media. Maybe it's caused by the location of the speaker: it's on the bottom of the laptop. Luckily I'm not the kind of guy that uses his laptop speakers a lot: I'll be using my headphones anyway.

As you can see, the upsides clearly outweigh the downsides and I would recommend the Lemur to anyone who is planning on buying a piece of hardware that is meant to run Linux.
