Yay, I will be picking my very own kitchen this saturday, just thought I'd let you guys know =]

I'm glad I took my mom with me last saturday. They almost sold me a kitchen for over &euro; 4.000,- which I can get at different stores for &euro; 2600,-. I mean..what the hell? It's the same kitchen?! How can there be this huge gap between two companies selling kitchens? Thanks to my parents, I just saved loads of cash. Pfew.
