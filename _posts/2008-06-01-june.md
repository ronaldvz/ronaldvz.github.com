It's June. And June is great! Wanna know why? June is the month the construction of my very own apartment will start!

A couple of weeks ago I bought myself a brand new digital camera to be able to shoot some pics of the place during the construction. If all goes well my new home will be finished somewhere near August next year. Can't wait really! Anyhow, thought I'd let you guys know :).

June is also the month the European Championship (soccer!) will start. Now let me get one thing straight: I am NOT a soccerfan.... However, I just can't get my head around the loads of Dutch people whining about our team not being strong enough to have a chance at this championship. The dutch are being...what do you call it...pessimists! I'm fed up with that! There's nothing wrong with a bit of pattriotism, I'm proud of my country and I'm supporting our soccerteam! As we all should! Where's the spirit? Let's win these championships already!!

Ahum, enough of this blabb..I'm off to bed.
