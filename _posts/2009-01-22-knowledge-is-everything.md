Working in software development is all about knowledge. As a software developer it's important to keep learning new techniques and methods. Education is vital to keep your worth as an employee in the IT-industry.

This is one of the valuable lessons learned from a book called 'Pragmatic Programming'.

Over 1,25 years ago, I started working at <a title="Sogyo!" href="http://www.sogyo.nl" target="_blank">Sogyo</a> and was presented my own copy of this book. I really enjoyed reading it back then. Every now and then I still take the time to go through a chapter or two to refresh my memory and review some of the valuable lessons taught by the authors.

Going through my RSS-feeds today, one of my colleagues at Sogyo <a title="Dutch book review by Ralf Wolter (Sogyo)" href="http://www.software-innovators.nl/2009/01/08/boek-recentie-pragmatic-thinking-and-learning/">reminded me</a> of the fact that this book, as well as many other books in these series, are very well written and -most importantly- are readable for everyone (even those who don't have the natural drive to read through 2 books a week). That's why I decided to order three new books, hoping I will be able to read through these in let's say 6 months.

I ordered the following:

<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/ahptl/pragmatic-thinking-and-learning"><img title="Pragmatic Thinking &amp; Learning" src="http://www.pragprog.com/images/covers/120x144/ahptl.jpg?1205368653" alt="" width="120" height="144" /></a>

<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/pad/practices-of-an-agile-developer"><img title="Practices of an Agile Developer" src="http://www.pragprog.com/images/covers/190x228/pad.jpg?1223489242" alt="" width="120" height="144" /></a>

<a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/utj/pragmatic-unit-testing-in-java-with-junit"><img title="Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java with JUnit" src="http://www.pragprog.com/images/covers/190x228/utj.jpg?1223488951" alt="" width="120" height="144" /></a>

Should be enough to read I believe, or am I missing any good books?
