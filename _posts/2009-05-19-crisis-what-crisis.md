Yesterday I had the privilege of cleaning the hallway, toilet and bathroom of our home. These are being used frequently by me and eight homies. Either the economic crisis hasn't come to the attention of my homies, or my homies have a (very!) high standard of personal hygiene: 34 freaking bottles of shampoo in the bathroom(!)

I could be mistaken though. The amount of bottles could also indicate we all buy the crap, but don't use it that often...heheh.

PS. Personally I can account for 2 bottles.
