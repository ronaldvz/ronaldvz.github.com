Aww how delightful. As of this afternoon I'm enjoying a week of doing absolutely nothing. It's not until July 21st before I get back to work again. Hope I won't miss it (although I actually might...:S). Plans for the coming week:

* Monday: visiting a place called 'Kaatsheuvel' with my gf to enjoy some rollercoasters =]
* Tuesday: helping [Matt](http://www.monkeyandmachine.com) doing absolutely nothing
* Wednesday: doing absolutely nothing
* Thursday: I might do absolutely nothing
* Friday: As it's been a hard week of doing nothing, I might consider doing absolutely nada.

Think I might be off to visit Hancock this week, which should be fun :). I love the trailers of this movie!
