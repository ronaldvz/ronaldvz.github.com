In the past two weeks I've been off to France with my girlfriend. The first half of our vacation we spent our time in a little place called Die, near a river called the Drome. Our daily activities were: walking to the Drome, sunning by the Drome, walking to our tent, eat, sleep, walking to the Drome etc.. Only exception on this circle of activities was the exciting event of canoeing on the Drome.

Just to give you an impression of the lazy two weeks we spent in the sun; click <a title="Pics of holiday in France" href="http://picasaweb.google.com/ronaldvanzuijlen/HolidayFranceAugust2008#" target="_blank">here</a> for some pics! I will be uploading more pictures in the coming week.
