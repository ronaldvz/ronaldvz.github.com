In my spare time during last week, I've tried to NOT touch my computer. This is quite a task when everyone around you is either working or enjoying the sun at some place far away. Still, it worked out pretty well I believe. As my appetite for computing was decreasing anyway, I've decided to search for some other things to do while 'off duty'. (I can do the comp-thing at work, right?)

## Guitar

Thanks to my girlfriend, I am now able to play some guitar.Can't play anything cool just yet, although 'Nirvana - Come as you are' is quite easy to play. Don't have any intentions to start a new career as a musician, but hey, why not play a bit. It's fun. Might come in handy someday.

Apart from playing my, i mean her, guitar ;), I'm reading my..her..book called 'Trouweloos' written by Karin Slaughter. Although I've only read two chapters, it's quite intriguing and also a nice way to kill some time. It's a thriller and I like the story i'm being told.

## Little Gamer

Ah well, as everyone knows I've always been a fan of gaming, so the lack of computing got evened up last week by playing this nasty thing: <a href="http://www.ronaldvanzuijlen.nl/images/ps.jpg" target="_blank">the Playstation 3</a>... (Ratchet and Clank is awesome!)

Guess I'll always be a little gamer...pity the PS3 is not mine ^_^

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to nurture Sanne. She has the flue :(
