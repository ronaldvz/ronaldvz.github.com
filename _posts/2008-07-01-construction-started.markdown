Erhh hah! It's July! Time for a new post :P. I made a lot of promises in my last post, so here are some pics of my future home:

The last picture shows pretty much how it looks right now. Not quite a home yet, but I'm happy with every week of progress :). Every day I'm getting closer to being a model citizen. My home is not the only thing making that happen: I'm driving a car since last week :). With the 'hank hank' and the 'vroem vroem' (The one who guesses from which movie that line is, get an icecream!) I'm making my way to work every day now. My latest adventure was this morning, driving from Utrecht to Amsterdam to make it to an appointment at Getronics. I made it to Amsterdam, but finding the darn building was...difficult. Took me twenty minutes and 3 phonecalls to find it :).

Top priority on my wishlist: TomTom!

Furthermore, I can't wait for my week off. After next week, I can relax :)
