Ever since I started working at <a title="F&amp;F" href="http://www.forest-fields.nl" target="_blank">Forest &amp; Fields</a>, I've had the opportunity to participate in projectteams creating large commercial websites in the Netherlands. As some of you might already know, I've been assigned on a French project two months ago. I find this project to be a very interesting and although we're using a framework built by a different company, I'm still learning quite a lot about the Escenic CMS.

The weird thing about the project is that we've never seen our customer in real life yet. Last week I received an e-mail from our customer in which she requested to meet up. So as a result, I'm visiting Paris for this meet-up together with our projectleader on October 1st. Yay :)
