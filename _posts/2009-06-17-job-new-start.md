This month I started a new step in my career at <a href="http://www.vlc.nl">VLC</a>. After a jobsearch of approximately four weeks, I had the luxury of choice in several job opportunities. VLC is the company that provides personal growth through training, interesting technologies and above all, a chance to prove myself as a consultant. These are the main reasons I chose VLC as the place I'd like to continue my career.

In the first month of work I'll be educated through a masterclass program in which I will learn the basics of Enterprise Information Management, which results in a training in Documentum and GX as two Content Management Systems. When this month of training is done, I will be sent to one of VLC's customers to 'prove my worth'. In other words: I'm excited :).

<small>Note: VLC has been [renamed](/2011/10/26/vlc-becomes-incentro.html) to Incentro.</small>
