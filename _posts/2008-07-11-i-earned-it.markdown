Aww how delightful. As of this afternoon I'm enjoying a week of doing absolutely nothing. It's not until July 21st before I get back to work again. Hope I won't miss it (although I actually might...:S). Plans for the coming week:

Monday: visiting a place called 'Kaatsheuvel' with my gf to enjoy some rollercoasters =]
Tuesday: helping <a title="Matt" href="http://www.monkeyandmachine.com" target="_blank">Matt</a> doing absolutely nothing
Wednesday: doing absolutely nothing
Thursday:  i might do absolutely nothing
Friday: As it's been a hard week of doing nothing,  I might consider doing absolutely nada.

Think I might be off to visit Hancock this week, which should be fun :). I love the trailers of this movie!
